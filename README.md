# Introduction

This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different  locations.
The data is not real and is provided by codecademy.com


There are four main questions:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?
