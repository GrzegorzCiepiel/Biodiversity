# Biodiversity - data analyse

## Introduction

This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different  locations.
The data is not real and is provided by codecademy.com



## Scpping

To help quide a projekt proces there are four sections to follow:
- Project Goals
- Data
- Analysis
- Evaluation

1. In this project I analyse two csv files from National Parks Service. The main goal is understanding characteristics about species and their conservation status.
There are four main questions:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?

2. There are two csv files. First csv file has information about species and another one has observations about species in the national parks.

3. We need to check:
   - distributions
   - relationship between species
   - species conservation status
   - observations of species in parks
  
4. Last part is to reflect what informations did we get from this analyse. Were we able to answer all question? Write explanation if not.
